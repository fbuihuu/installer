To build all *.po into *.mo, use 'python setup build_i18n'. That will
build and put all mo files in build/mo directory inside the project
topdir.

If you need to update the translation (*.po), first generate the pot
file, 'python setup build_i18n' should care of that. Then update po
file with: 'intltool-update --dist fr -g installer' for the french
translation for example.
