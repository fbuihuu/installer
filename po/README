To build all *.po into *.mo, use 'python setup build_i18n'. That will
build and put all mo files in build/mo directory inside the project
topdir.

If you need to update the translation (*.po), first generate the pot
file, 'python setup build_i18n' should care of that. Then update po
file with: 'intltool-update --dist fr -g installer' for the french
translation for example.

Or simply do 'python setup.py build_i18n --merge-po' which will update
the .pot file, merge the .po files and build the *.mo ones.
